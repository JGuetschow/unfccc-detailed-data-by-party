### The following countries have new or changed data:
* Bosnia and Herzegovina: new data for 2012 and 2014 for individual gases and for aggregate Kyoto gases complete new timeseries from 2001 to 2014. Data unchanged from 1990 to 2000
* Chile: 2010, Kyoto GHG, category 2 datapoint that seemed erroneus in the last version has been corrected.
* Dominican Republic: Data for Year 2010 has been added.
* Ecuador: Data for 2012 has been added. Historical data has been changed (some data points have been removed). 1994 emissions are much higher than emissions for subsequent years.

* Viet Nam: Data for Year 2013 has been added.

Small changes in individual sectors might be missing as countries where only investigated in detail where changes we visible in CATM0EL Kyoto GHG data.

### General problems
* Belize: Aggregate Kyoto GHG CATM0EL data does not coincide with calculated sums for years 2003, 2006, and 2009. (not a change actually)
